Send notes in current buffer to Anki.

For each note heading, if there's no note id in property drawer,
create a note, otherwise, update fields and tags of the existing
note.

If one fails, the failure reason will be set in property drawer
of that heading.

(autoload 'anki-editor-insert-note "anki-editor" "\
Insert the skeleton of a note.

The contents to be insrted are structured with a note heading
along with subheadings that correspond to fields.

Where the note is inserted depends on where the point is.

When the point is somewhere inside a note heading, the new note
is inserted below this note with same heading level.

Or when the point is outside any note heading but inside a
heading that isn't tagged with 'deck' but under a deck heading,
the new note is one level lower to and is inserted at the bottom
of this heading.

Or when the point is inside a deck heading, the behavior is the
same as above.

Otherwise, it's inserted below current heading at point.

bugfixes or new features of AnkiConnect.
